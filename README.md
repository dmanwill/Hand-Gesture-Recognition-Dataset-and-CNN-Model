# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Dataset-and-CNN-Model-
EECS 605 final project. Collected a custom dataset of hand gestures (number of fingers held up on one hand) and trained a CNN model from scratch to classify each gesture. Then deployed this model to a Heroku web app and an AWS DeepLens device.

See Project Documentation folder for writeups about the dataset, model, deployment to the Heroku app and Deeplens device, and a video demo.
